# blackjack

Last assignment for Python 1 course

Simplified game requirements:
The possible card values range from 1 to 10 and, unlike a real deck, the
probability of drawing a card is equal

The game begins by dealing two visible cards to the player (face up), and two
cards to the dealer. However, in the case of the dealer, one card is visible to
other players while the other is hidden.

The player decides whether to "hit" (draw another card), or "stand" which ends
their turn.

The player may hit any number of times. Should the total of the cards exceed 21,
the player "busts" and loses the game to the dealer.

If the player reaches 21, the player stands The dealer's turn begins by
revealing the hidden card.  The dealer must hit if the total is 16 or less, and
must stand if the value is 17 or more.  The dealer wins all ties (i.e. if both
the dealer and the player reach 21, the dealer wins)

The program indicates who the winner is and asks to play again
